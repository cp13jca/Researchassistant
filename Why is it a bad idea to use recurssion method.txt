Question: Why is it a bad idea to use recurssion method
 to find the fibonacci of a number ?

Response: Recursion uses more memory.
Because the function has to add to the stack with each recursive
call and keep the values there until the call is finished.
The memory allocation is greater tha that of an iterative function.
Recursion can be slow.
